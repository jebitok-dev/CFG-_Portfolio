  Code First Girls - Week 4

  This exercise file gives you the basic HTML structure that you need
  to get started with the exercises that will come up as we go through
  the content.
  
  Don't worry if you get stuck, our instructors are walking around to help
  and we will go through the answer as a group. 
  
  Below are the exercises to complete:
  Exercise 4.1.1 - First, comment out your custom stylesheet for now to remove the flexbox styling. 
                   Then, on your homepage add the container class in a div that wraps 
                   both the header and main elements.
  Exercise 4.1.2 - Create a row class in a div element that surrounds your paragraph and image as a whole, 
                   now add two div elements that surround the paragraph and image content individually. 
                   Now add the following classes to each:
                   - col-xs-12 to ensure they are full width on mobiles
                   - col-md-6 to ensure they are both 50% width on desktop

  Exercise 4.2.1 - Change the buttons on your “My Top 5” and “Contact Me” forms to bootstrap buttons.   
  Exercise 4.2.2 - Follow the bootstrap website for adding a Navbar component, and include your 
                   three list elements inside of the nav component. This should replace what you 
                   currently have in your nav element (notice how the Navbar component also includes the nav element)
              
  Exercise 4.3.1 - In place of your introduction image on your About Me page, add a carousel with a 
                   couple of new images that scrolls automatically.

  Exercise 4.4.1 - Follow the bootstrap website to change your forms on “My Top 5” and “Contact Me” by 
                   adding the required classes and attributes. Ensure to keep the same fields as before, 
                   we’ll need these next week.
  
  Exercise 4.5.1 - On your “Contact Me” page, add a Modal that is triggered when you click on the “Submit” button. 
                   Again, use the bootstrap website. Add some text that confirms submission for now, we will come back 
                   to this soon. Note: You may need to take the Submit button out of the form to do this.

  Exercise 4.6.1 - Create a new css file, or uncomment and alter your current one to re-apply the colours, fonts, 
                   font sizing and margins to make our website look less “bootstrappy”.
